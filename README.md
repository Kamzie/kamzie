### My self-taught journey so far:

---

1. Completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses on FreeCodeCamp, creating projects such as a web portfolio, resume, responsive website, and API apps intended for cloud deployment.

   - [Responsive Website](https://github.com/Kamzie/Hayao-Miyazaki---Website)
   - [API Projects](https://github.com/Kamzie/FCC-JavaScript-Projects---API-Apps)

2. Transitioned from CodePen to VSCode, GitHub, and Git Bash, while moving to Linux to improve my system administration skills and gain hands-on Bash scripting experience.

3. Created various bash scripts using VIM to automate tasks such as user and network management, backup and deletion (cloud-based), security monitoring via logs, and some personal scripts I use daily.
